       <p>Photography is something that is acquired from practice. A talent on the other hand is a naturally gifted ability to preform some sort of action. In other words, what distinguishes the two from each other is the placement of where this so called “ability” resonates from — from practice or from natural disposition.

        A proficient photographer might have accrued their ability by having a natural eye for composition or light. On the other side of this, some photographers might have developed a skill set that allows them utilize his or hers camera to it’s fullest potential.
        
        We do believe however that a strong line exists between artistic talent and technical skill when it comes to photography. When we discuss skill, we generally are speaking of the ability to control the aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, etc. of a camera.Indeed, the ability and knowledge of how to manipulate a cameras function is very important to good photography. But the usefulness of this ability is sometimes not paired correctly with the drive to correctly utilize those skills. You could know as much as you want about how beneficial it is to have a half-pressed remote shutter focus analyzer but if you have no artistic talent, creativity, or appreciation for light and it’s bewildering properties, then it is difficult to become a great photographer.
        
        So to answer the question more directly, photography an art form is the ability to hedge both artistic talent and technical skill — it is not one or the other.</p>
